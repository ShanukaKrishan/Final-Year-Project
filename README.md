# AR Watch Store

## Summary

Smart e-commerce watch store is a prototype made for the sole purpose of converting an online store into an Augmented Reality Store. The store will give the option for users to try on the product virtually before buying it. The present issue of the watch store is the inability to allow users to try on their products or have any interactive experience with the consumers, which causes the customer to second guess their decision-making. As a result, the product is more likely to be returned because the consumer does not like how the watch fits on their wrist. This results in losses for the company and prevents it from gaining loyal clients. The solution to increasing revenue and increasing customer satisfaction is allowing the customer to try on the product before checking out. Because of covid, interest in Augmented Reality has grown. People are more aware of AR than ever before and integrating AR into a business boosts its power to sell more and lower losses. That is how a company grows. 
 
Furthermore, for a firm to thrive, it must attract customers. As a result, artificial voice recognition has been incorporated into the smartwatch shop. Changing the way an e-commerce business operates requires public permission. A survey was conducted on a few students, which resulted in a good response regarding the e-commerce revolution. The primary purpose of implementing AR and AI in a store is to improve business income while decreasing business losses. Not only that, but the AR function enables customers to make better judgments from home, which is helpful during times of lockdown and mirrors the core purpose by allowing the firm to stay afloat during pandemics.
